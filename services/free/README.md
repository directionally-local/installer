# Free managed tier service

A portable Worker with Durable Objects (SQLite) that gives signed-in people a weekly allowance of
`deepseek/deepseek-v4.1-flash-1017` through OpenRouter. Sign-in is GitHub by device code. The
contract is in `src/app.ts`, and the refusal sentences are in `src/messages.ts`.

A sign-in code lasts 15 minutes (`expires_in: 900`), long enough to open the link on a phone
and sign in to GitHub there. The terminal polls every 5 seconds.

## Admission

There is one account per GitHub user, keyed on the numeric GitHub id.

- **Invite-only (the default, `OPEN_ADMISSION=false`).** Everyone except admins needs an unused
  invite code.
- **Open admission (`OPEN_ADMISSION=true`, or the admin override).** GitHub accounts at least
  `MIN_GITHUB_ACCOUNT_AGE_DAYS` (30) old get in without a code. Younger accounts still need one.
- In both modes, new people stop at `MAX_ACTIVE_USERS` (admins aren't counted). A device that
  already holds another account's grant is refused, and each network gets 3 new accounts a day.

## Refusals

Every refusal is `{"error": {"code", "message", ...}}`. The browser page and `error.message`
use the same sentence, so a client that doesn't know a code can show the message as it is.

| code | where | extra |
|---|---|---|
| `account_too_new` | `POST /v1/device/token` | `reason` |
| `invite_required` | `POST /v1/device/token` | `reason` |
| `cohort_full` | `POST /v1/device/token` | `reason` |
| `too_many_signups` | `POST /v1/device/token` | `reason` |
| `access_denied` | `POST /v1/device/token` | `reason: "device_taken"` when the device holds another account's grant |
| `service_paused` | device code, device token, chat | `reason: "paused"`, `pausedForEveryone: true`, `resetsAt: null` |
| `global_weekly_budget_reached` | chat (503) | `reason: "weekly_budget"`, `pausedForEveryone: true`, `resetsAt` (ISO time), `Retry-After` header |
| `global_total_budget_reached` | chat (503) | `reason: "total_budget"`, `pausedForEveryone: true`, `resetsAt: null` |
| `quota_exceeded` | chat (402) | `reason: "tokens" \| "spend"`, `resetsAt` |
| `not_invited` | API, and older sign-ins | none |

The two global budget codes mean "free tokens are paused for everyone, and your own key still
works". The weekly one says when free tokens come back. The total one has no reset time: free
tokens come back only if the owner raises the cap.

## Runtime settings

These settings come from `env`. An admin can override them while the service runs, with no
release. Overrides live in the Directory object, and every change, pauses included, is logged
with who made it and when.

| setting | env | default |
|---|---|---|
| `weeklyTokens` | `WEEKLY_TOKENS` | 50,000,000 |
| `perPersonWeeklyUsdCap` | `PER_PERSON_WEEKLY_USD_CAP` | 5 |
| `globalWeeklyUsdCap` | `GLOBAL_WEEKLY_USD_CAP` | 250 |
| `globalTotalUsdCap` | `GLOBAL_TOTAL_USD_CAP` | 1000 |
| `maxActiveUsers` | `MAX_ACTIVE_USERS` | 50 |
| `openAdmission` | `OPEN_ADMISSION` | false |
| `cachedTokenWeight` | `CACHED_TOKEN_WEIGHT` | 0.02 |

```sh
# Read the effective values, the env values, the overrides and the change log
curl -H "authorization: Bearer $ADMIN_TOKEN" https://free.example.com/admin/config

# Set values. null goes back to the env value; USD caps also take "none" (no cap).
curl -H "authorization: Bearer $ADMIN_TOKEN" -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  -d '{"weeklyTokens": 60000000, "globalWeeklyUsdCap": 300, "openAdmission": null}' \
  https://free.example.com/admin/config
```

## What counts against the weekly allowance

```
charged = uncached prompt tokens + completion tokens + ceil(cached prompt tokens × cachedTokenWeight)
```

The default weight of 0.02 is OpenRouter's cache-read price divided by its input price for
`deepseek/deepseek-v4.1-flash-1017`: $0.006/M over $0.30/M, as listed on 2026-11-03.
`COUNT_CACHED_TOKENS=false` still works and means a weight of 0, unless `CACHED_TOKEN_WEIGHT`
is set. The USD caps always use the real cost OpenRouter reports.

## Which OpenRouter host serves requests

Every chat request asks OpenRouter for the cheapest host that passes two filters, with fallbacks
on among the hosts that pass:

```json
"provider": { "sort": "price", "allow_fallbacks": true,
              "quantizations": ["fp8", "mxfp8", "fp16", "bf16", "fp32"], "data_collection": "deny" }
```

- **Full precision.** DeepSeek V4.1 Flash 1017 ships FP8 weights, so FP8 and anything wider
  is allowed. FP6, FP4, integer quantizations and hosts that don't state a precision
  (`unknown`) are excluded.
- **No prompt collection.** `data_collection: "deny"` keeps only hosts OpenRouter lists as
  neither training on nor storing prompts. DeepSeek's own host is excluded by this filter.

Each setting has an env var and an admin override (`POST /admin/config`):

| setting | env | default |
|---|---|---|
| `openRouterProviderOrder` | `OPENROUTER_PROVIDER_ORDER` (comma-separated slugs) | empty: no pinned host, cheapest first |
| `openRouterQuantizations` | `OPENROUTER_QUANTIZATIONS` (comma-separated levels) | `fp8,mxfp8,fp16,bf16,fp32`; empty means no filter |
| `openRouterDataCollection` | `OPENROUTER_DATA_COLLECTION` | `deny` (`allow` is permitted) |
| `openRouterHostCooldownMinutes` | `OPENROUTER_HOST_COOLDOWN_MINUTES` | `10`; `0` turns host avoidance off |

Setting an order sends `order` instead of `sort`. The filters still apply, so a pinned host
that fails them is skipped. Hosts bill different prices for the same model, so check
`requests.cost_usd` after any change.

As a backstop on the company key, also turn off "Allow providers that may train on inputs" in
OpenRouter's account privacy settings.

### Steering around a failing host

OpenRouter says which host served each response: the `provider` field of a completion or of
each stream chunk, and `error.metadata.provider_name` on an error. When a request fails in a
way the host is to blame for (an HTTP 5xx naming the host, an error body, or a stream that
carries an error or ends without `[DONE]`), that host is listed as failing for
`openRouterHostCooldownMinutes` (10 by default). A client closing its stream, a 4xx, a 429
and an error that names no host don't count.

While a host is listed, new requests add it to `ignore`, and the filters and the sort pick
the next host:

```json
"provider": { "sort": "price", "allow_fallbacks": true,
              "quantizations": ["fp8", "mxfp8", "fp16", "bf16", "fp32"], "data_collection": "deny",
              "ignore": ["morph"] }
```

If OpenRouter then answers that no host is available, the request is sent once more without
`ignore`. The list is one small table in the rate-limiter object `openrouter-hosts`, shared
by every request. Each row is a host and when it last failed; whether it still counts is
decided from the current cooldown, so a change, or `0`, applies to the next request.

Each request with a known host adds to `host_daily` (requests and failures per host per day),
and each failure adds a row to `host_failures` (time, host, `http_5xx` | `error_body` |
`stream`, upstream status). Counts only, never content. `GET /admin/metrics` returns
`hosts: [{host, requests, failures, failureRate}]` for its date range.

## Sign-out and server keys

- **Sign out:** `POST /v1/token/revoke`. Send the access token as the bearer, `{"refresh_token"}`
  in the body, or both. This ends that sign-in session: its refresh tokens are deleted, so
  refresh fails, and its access tokens stop working at once. The person's other sessions keep
  working. An unknown refresh token still gets a 200.
- **Admin, revoke everything for one person:** `POST /admin/people/:id/revoke-tokens`. This ends
  every session and deletes every server key. The person can sign in again.
- **Server keys:** long-lived, named and revocable keys for a server that runs agents
  unattended. All three endpoints need a signed-in access token; a server key can't call them.

  | request | response |
  |---|---|
  | `POST /v1/keys {"name": "build-box"}` | 201 `{id, name, key, createdAt, lastUsedAt}`. `key` is shown only here. |
  | `GET /v1/keys` | `{keys: [{id, name, createdAt, lastUsedAt}], max: 5}` |
  | `DELETE /v1/keys/:id` | `{id, revoked: true}`, or 404 `key_not_found` |

  - **Where a key works:** `Authorization: Bearer dlk_…` on `/v1/chat/completions`,
    `/v1/models`, `/v1/me` and `/v1/events`. Usage is charged to the same account.
  - **Storage:** only the SHA-256 of the secret is kept.
  - **Limits:** at most 5 keys per account (409 `key_limit_reached`), and names must be unique
    within an account (409 `key_name_taken`).
  - **Errors:** a wrong or revoked key gets 401 `invalid_key`. Signing out leaves keys working.
  - **Admin view:** `/admin/people` shows how many keys each person has, never the keys.

A per-person grant (`POST /admin/people/:id/grant`) still wins over the weekly defaults. The kill
switch is `POST /admin/pause` and `/admin/unpause`; `PAUSED=true` in env pauses as well.

## Admin dashboard

`GET /admin` is a server-rendered page for admins: weekly active developers (3+ days and any
day, last 8 weeks), cohort retention (weeks 1, 2 and 4 after sign-up), cost per person per week
(total, median, mean, and the top 10 of any week), who reached their token or dollar allowance
this week and last (and on which day), and global spend against the effective caps with the
pause and admission state. Each table has a CSV at `/admin/dashboard/<table>.csv`
(`spend`, `weekly-active`, `retention`, `weekly-cost`, `top-cost?week=YYYY-MM-DD`, `limits`).

- **Admins are left out of every number:** anyone in `ADMIN_GITHUB_IDS` and anyone admitted as
  an admin.
- **What it reads:** only `daily_activity`, a per-person per-day roll-up of request and event
  counts, charged tokens and cost, plus GitHub logins, sign-up times, per-person grants and the
  spend totals. No model, event type or properties, session ids, prompts or code. A test runs
  the dashboard under an SQLite authorizer that allows only those columns.
- **The roll-up** is kept up to date with each request and event, and built once from the
  existing log the first time this version starts.
- **Reached the allowance** means charged tokens at 99% of the token allowance (the last
  request's reservation can't fit in the final 1%) or cost at the dollar allowance, using
  today's allowances, including grants set with `POST /admin/people/:id/grant` from this version
  on.
- **Sign-in:** "Sign in with GitHub" on the page runs the OAuth web flow with exactly the
  OAuth app's registered callback, `redirect_uri=<PUBLIC_URL>/device/callback`, so the app
  needs no change (it matches redirect URIs exactly). Device sign-in comes back to the same
  callback; the sign-in `state` is stored with its purpose (`admin` or `device`), which picks
  the flow, and each flow refuses the other's state. The old `/device/callback/admin` path still
  works for now as an alias. Only ids in `ADMIN_GITHUB_IDS` get a session: an
  HttpOnly, Secure, SameSite=Strict `__Host-` cookie holding a signed one-hour token that can't
  be used as an API bearer token. Sign-out ends it at once. Scripts can send an admin access
  token as the bearer instead.
